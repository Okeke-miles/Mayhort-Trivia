# Mayhort-Trivia
In this project, I simulated a professional work environment. I made sketches of how the design would look before proceeding. I used a pseudo kanban board to list tasks and tick them off based on completion.

I had 24 hours to build this application along with a pair programmer. This prototype was my sole design. To see the collaborative work with the pair programmer, please check my repositories under the name "Pair Program"
TOOLS
I used Sass for the styling. 
I used React, Express and Node.js

IF I HAD MORE TIME
If I had more time, I would refactor some of the code to keep up to date with DRY principles.
